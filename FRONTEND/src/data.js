        content: "Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes.\n\nThe first little pig was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw. The second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks. Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.\n\nThe third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks. It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney. It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds.\n\nThe next day, a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little pigs lived; and he saw the straw house, and he smelled the pig inside. He thought the pig would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth began to water.\n\nSo he knocked on the door and said:\n\nLittle pig! Little pig!\nLet me in! Let me in!\n\nBut the little pig saw the wolf's big paws through the keyhole, so he answered back:\n\nNo! No! No!\nNot by the hairs on my chinny chin chin!\n\nSo the wolf showed his teeth and said:\n\nThen I'll huff\nand I'll puff\nand I'll blow your house down!\n\nSo he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf was greedy and he tried to catch both pigs at once, but he was too greedy and got neither! His big jaws clamped down on nothing but air and the two little pigs scrambled away as fast as their little hooves would carry them.\n\nThe wolf chased them down the lane and he almost caught them. But they made it to the brick house and slammed the door closed before the wolf could catch them. The three little pigs they were very frightened, they knew the wolf wanted to eat them. And that was very, very true. The wolf hadn't eaten all day and he had worked up a large appetite chasing the pigs around and now he could smell all three of them inside and he knew that the three little pigs would make a lovely feast.\n\nSo the wolf knocked on the door and said:\n\nLittle pigs! Little pigs!\nLet me in! Let me in!\n\nBut the little pigs saw the wolf's narrow eyes through the keyhole, so they answered back:\n\nNo! No! No!\nNot by the hairs on our chinny chin chins!\n\nSo the wolf showed his teeth and said:\n\nThen I'll huff\nand I'll puff\nand I'll blow your house down!\n\nHe huffed and he puffed. He puffed and he huffed; but he could not blow the house down. At last, he was so out of breath that he couldn't huff and he couldn't puff anymore. So he stopped to rest and thought a bit.\n\nBut this was too much. The wolf danced about with rage and swore he would come down the chimney and eat up the little pig for his supper. But while he was climbing on to the roof the little pig made up a blazing fire and put on a big pot full of water to boil. Then, just as the wolf was coming down the chimney, the little piggy pulled off the lid, and plop! in fell the wolf into the scalding water.\n\nSo the little piggy put on the cover again, boiled the wolf up, and the three little pigs ate him for supper."

One day they decided to play football to see who the best player was.\n\nThey went to the football field and started their game. Chicken was fast, but Millipede was faster. Chicken kicked far, but Millipede kicked further. Chicken started to feel grumpy.\n\nThey decided to play a penalty shoot-out. First Millipede was goal keeper. Chicken scored only one goal. Then it was the chicken’s turn to defend the goal.\n\nMillipede kicked the ball and scored. Millipede dribbled the ball and scored. Millipede headed the ball and scored. Millipede scored five goals.\n\nChicken was furious that she lost. She was a very sore loser. Millipede started laughing because his friend was making such a fuss.\n\nChicken was so angry that she opened her beak wide and swallowed the millipede.\n\nAs Chicken was walking home, she met Mother Millipede. Mother Millipede asked, “Have you seen my child?” Chicken didn’t say anything. Mother Millipede was worried.\n\nThen Mother Millipede heard a tiny voice. “Help me mom!” cried the voice. Mother Millipede looked around and listened carefully. The voice came from inside the chicken.\n\nMother Millipede shouted, “Use your special power my child!” Millipedes can make a bad smell and a terrible taste. Chicken began to feel ill.\n\nChicken burped. Then she swallowed and spat. Then she sneezed and coughed. And coughed. The millipede was disgusting!\n\nChicken coughed until she coughed out the millipede that was in her stomach. Mother Millipede and her child crawled up a tree to hide.\n\nFrom that time, chickens and millipedes were enemies."

        title: "The Story of Yes and No",
        author: "Daniel Errico",
        cover: "the-story-of-yes-and-no.jpg",
        stars: 4,
        content: "Before words were words, a boy named Yes lived in a small village in a small kingdom. Yes was good at everything. He was the best, smartest and most liked person in his village.\n\nYes had a brother, and his name was No. No was jealous of his brother, because he was not much good at anything himself. Whenever the villagers asked No for help, he refused because he didn’t like people very much.  Whenever someone asked Yes for a favor, he would gladly help, and he secretly didn’t mind the fact that it irritated No when he did\n\nOne day Yes and No’s father, Okay went on a long journey and he left his two sons in charge of all the animals. Yes took good care of the great guck, and the icks, and the three-toed yock. [Keep in mind, my dear friend, that the guck, ick, and three-toed yock were very old animals, so you might know them by different names today.]\n\nNo didn’t want to be bothered with the boring tasks involved with taking care of the animals. So instead of helping his brother, No went down to the lake and threw rocks into the water.\n\nA few days after his father left, Yes asked his brother to watch the three-toed yock while he went to find some food to eat. Instead of doing what Yes asked, No lay down, shut his eyes, and forgot about the yock.\n\nIt just so happened that the King had a personal road nearby, and he traveled on it often.  So often, that when the three-toed yock wandered onto the road, the King’s carriage was passing by and had to swerve to avoid hitting it.  The King was thrown from the carriage and fell to the ground and hurt himself.\n\nThe King demanded to know why a three-toed yock had been allowed on his road and asked all the villagers for an explanation. Yes was always honest, so he told the King the entire story.\n\nThe King thought for a moment, and then he came up with an idea that he was quite happy with. Yes and No were to work in the castle as his personal assistants as punishment for what was later referred to as the worst three-toed yock and carriage accident in the Kingdom’s history.\n\nThe King needed help with many things around the castle because a King cannot be bothered with the daily tasks involved with running a Kingdom.  However, soon after his decision about the two brothers, the King realized that only Yes would be of any use to him as a servant.  Whenever the King asked No to bring him anything, it would get thrown away, broken, or eaten, without exception. The King was quite sure that No was the worst servant in the entire world.\n\nThe brothers’ most important task was to help pick the food for a grand party that the King was throwing later that night. Cooks from all over the Kingdom lined up at the castle’s gate to offer the King their food for the party.  Of course, the King could not go and grab the food himself, so he asked Yes and No to do it for him.\n\nThe first cook came up the gate and yelled to the Gatekeeper, “I bring my delicious ugberry pie for the King’s banquet!”  The King heard this and thought that ugberry pie would be perfect for such an event (and he would love to eat the leftovers). He didn’t want anything to happen to the ugberry pie, so he yelled “Yes!” and then asked him to go fetch it.\n\nThe next cook stepped up to the gate. “I offer the King grukie soup!” he said.The King didn’t like grukie soup very much and he knew just how to get rid of it.\n\n“No!” he yelled and then sent No out to retrieve the soup. No dropped the soup before the King could even smell it.\n\nThis went on for hours. If the king liked a dish, he would yell “Yes!” and it would be included in the night’s feast. If he did not, everyone would hear a loud “NO!” and the dish would be destroyed moments later by a servant with a very bad attitude.\n\nPretty soon this started catching on around the Kingdom, for if a King does something, his loyal subjects are never far behind.  If they didn’t want a second scoop of potatoes, they would say “No.” And if they liked what someone was offering, they would say, “Yes.” And ever since that day in a small village in a small kingdom, Yes has meant Yes, and No has meant No.\n\nThis small kingdom also happens to be the birthplace of Yes and No’s cousins, Please and Thanks, but that is another story for another time…"

It grew past his eyes and he liked how it blew in every direction when it was windy outside. It grew past his nose and he liked how it moved when he shook his head around. It grew past his chin and he didn’t miss the barber at all.\n\nBut as his hair got longer, some things got harder.\n\nIt was harder for Sammy to see, since the hair covered his eyes.\nHe ate two stacks of napkins before he realized they weren’t pancakes.\n\nIt was harder for Sammy to wash his hair since it was so long.\nIn the shower he found two potato chips and a paper clip stuck in his hair.\n\nIt even got harder for Sammy to wear hats. His baseball cap couldn’t possibly fit on a head with so much hair.\n\nIt grew past his shoulders and Sammy didn’t know what to do with it.\nIt grew past his belly button and Sammy wasn’t enjoying his long hair as much as he used to.\nIt grew past his feet and Sammy kept tripping over it.\n\nSammy was not so happy with his long hair anymore.\n\nFinally, one morning his parents had enough so they marched up to his room to take him to the barber. But by that time his hair had filled up the entire room, and it was still growing!\n\nSammy squeezed out the front door and his hair followed behind.\nHe sat in the backseat of the car and his hair dragged behind him.\nHis parents sat him in the barber chair and his hair filled up the entire shop!\n\nWhen the haircut was over Sammy felt great. When he looked in the mirror he decided that maybe he was wrong about haircuts.\nEveryone was happy, except for the barber, who spent the next three days cleaning up all the hair he had cut."
